<p>4/16/06 - Attaching wire_formats.pdf - a first cut at defining all of the commands for both openwire an stomp.&#160; Working toward an architecture that will support both.&#160;</p>

<p>///////////////////////////////////////////////&#160;</p>

<p>Given that there are several separate efforts going on now toward the common goal of creating an ActiveMQ c++ client, I've put together a <a shape="rect" href="http://docs.codehaus.org/download/attachments/48149/ActiveMQClientArchitecture.pdf">doc</a>that attempts to merge our complete set of goals and propose an architecture (in rough form) that meets those goals.&#160; I've stored the document here because it was too large for the distribution list.</p>

<p> Please review and provide feedback at your earliest convenience.</p>

<p>&#160;Regards,</p>

<p>Nathan Mittler&#160;</p></div>
