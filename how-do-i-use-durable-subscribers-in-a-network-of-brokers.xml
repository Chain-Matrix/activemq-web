<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><p>Durable subscribers behave a little differently across a cluster of ActiveMQ brokers. The two main issues surround messages getting stuck on other brokers in the network after a durable subscriber has disconnected and reconnected to a different broker in the network without fully unsubscribing. The reasons for disconnecting/reconnecting can be voluntary (where the subscriber is using the failover transport), or involuntary (one of the brokers in the cluster fails).</p>

<p>For example, if you have two brokers A and B networked together in both directions to form a cluster, and a durable subscriber connects to broker B, a producer P on broker A will have its messages properly forwarded to broker B and the durable subscriber. However, if the subscriber disconnects and reconnects to broker A, any messages sent by P while the subscriber was away will be stuck on B until the subscriber reconnects to B. </p>

<p>The solution is to use <link><page ri:content-title="Virtual Destinations"></page></link></p>

<p>Virtual topics use queues under the covers and this allows ActiveMQ to treat each subscriber as a plain old Queue subscriber. This allows ActiveMQ to replay messages that have been orphaned on another broker in the cluster using this configuration as explained in the <link><page ri:content-title="Networks of Brokers"></page></link> documentation:</p>
