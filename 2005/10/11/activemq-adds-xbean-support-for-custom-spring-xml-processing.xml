<p>Craig has a <a shape="rect" href="http://jroller.com/page/habuma/20051011">great post</a> which describes how XBean can really help provide a <a shape="rect" href="http://docs.codehaus.org/display/XB/Custom+XML">customized XML language</a> with Spring XML configuration extensibility. We're really happy with it so far and have moved away from XSLT and custom DOM processing to the simpler XBean model in ActiveMQ and <a shape="rect" href="http://jencks.org">Jencks</a> with <a shape="rect" href="http://servicemix.org">ServiceMix</a> to follow suit real soon now.</p>
