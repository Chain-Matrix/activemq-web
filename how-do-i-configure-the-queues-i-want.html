<p>With ActiveMQ there is no real resaon to explicitly setup/configure the queues you are gonna need. If you try to publish or subscribe from any queue or topic it will be silently created on the fly.</p>

<p>Sometimes people put destinations into JNDI so that they can be pulled out by their application without needing to know the real, physical queue/topic name. This is fine, you can just add the ActiveMQQueue and ActiveMQTopic objects into JNDI (or any configuration mechanism you wish).</p>

<p>Also if you use the ActiveMQInitialContextFactory, then you can explicitly configure which destinations appear in the context using the jndi.properties approach. For more information please refer to the <a shape="rect" href="jndi-support.html">JNDI Support</a></p></div>
