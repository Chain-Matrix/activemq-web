<p>The Java documentation talks about <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-jms-efficiently.html">how to use JMS efficiently</a>. So when using .NET should you worry about pooling?</p>

<p>Its worth thinking about - but it depends a little on your application. If its a client UI then just have a single connection and a few sessions and you'll be fine. </p>

<p>If its more of a server, processing messages efficiently in a highly concurrent manner with loads of threads, then some kinda pooling mechanism such as in Spring.NET is preferable than trying to write that your self; as pooling of messaging artefacts (connections, sessions, producers, consumers) is way more complex than pooling of say, JDBC connections.</p></div>
