<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><h2>Background</h2>

<p>A retroactive consumer is just a regular NMS consumer who indicates that at the start of a subscription every attempt should be used to go back in time and send any old messages (or the last message sent on that topic) that the consumer may have missed.</p>

<p>See the <link><page ri:content-title="Subscription Recovery Policy" ri:space-key="ACTIVEMQ"></page></link> for more detail.</p>

<h3>Example</h3>

<p>You mark a Consumer as being retroactive as follows:</p>

<structured-macro ac:macro-id="ba59700d-4562-492c-a54b-67abdf21067a" ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1"><parameter ac:name="">java</parameter><plain-text-body>
var topic = session.GetTopic("TEST.Topic?consumer.retroactive=true");
var consumer = session.CreateConsumer(topic);
</plain-text-body></structured-macro>

<h2>Limitations</h2>

<p>Retroactive consumer will not consistently work when used across a network of brokers.</p>

<p>In the case of topics, when we connect broker A to broker B, broker B will send broker A all the subscriptions that it has received. Since Broker A replicates messages to each subscription, and we want to avoid receiving duplicates at broker B, we can't send broker A more than 1 subscription for the same topic. So our network bridges keep track of the subscriptions sent across and only send the first subscription to a topic. Subsequent subscriptions increment the reference count of the subscription, but the subscription is not actually sent.</p>

<p>This in essence is the problem. If the first subscription to a topic is not retroactive, it is sent B to A, and the B broker will not get the retroactive messages. Then subsequent subscriptions could be (retroactive), but it will not cause retroactive message to sent from broker A to broker B since the subsequent subscription will not be sent to broker A.</p></div>
