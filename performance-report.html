<p>If you're not convinced by performance reports then please do try running performance tests yourself. You might wanna check out our overview of <a shape="rect" href="performance.html">Performance</a> or try using out the <a shape="rect" href="activemq-performance-module-users-manual.html">ActiveMQ Performance Module Users Manual</a></p>
