<p>Performance differs greatly depending on many different factors</p>

<ul><li>the network <a shape="rect" href="topologies.html">topology</a></li><li>transport <a shape="rect" href="uri-protocols.html">protocols</a> used</li><li><a shape="rect" href="qos.html">quality of service</a></li><li>hardware, network, JVM and operating system</li><li>number of producers, number of consumers</li><li>distribution of messages across destinations along with message size</li></ul>


<p>To give you an idea of the kinds of performance you can expect from ActiveMQ we have a bunch of <a shape="rect" href="jmeter-performance-tests.html">JMeter Performance Tests</a> that you can run on your hardware with the protocols of your choice.</p>

<p>The last test run we ran was on a small network of 2 dual CPU opteron linux boxes (64 bit) running SuSe and with Java 5 from Sun.</p>

<p>When running the server on one box and a single producer and consumer thread in separate VMs on the other box, using a single topic we got around 21-22,000 messages/second using 1-2K messages. Another test running the broker on a Intel Celeron CPU 2.40GHz we got 2000 messages/second on a durable queue with 1 producer and 1 consumer thread on another box. So your milleage may vary greatly on your environment.</p>

<p>If you're not convinced by performance reports then please do try running performance tests yourself. You might wanna check out our overview of <a shape="rect" href="performance.html">Performance</a> or try using out the <a shape="rect" href="activemq-performance-module-users-manual.html">ActiveMQ Performance Module Users Manual</a></p>

<p>The Commercial Providers on the <a shape="rect" href="support.html">Support</a> page may also be able to help diagnose performance issues, suggest changes, etc...</p></div>
