<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><h2><strong>Overview of ActiveMQ-CPP</strong></h2>

<p>ActiveMQ CPP ships with a JMS 1.1-like API, called CMS.  This helps to make your C++ client code much neater and easier to follow.  In addition to CMS, ActiveMQ-CPP also provides a robust set of classes that support things such as threading, I/O, sockets, etc. You may find many of these classes useful, such as the "synchronized" macro that let's you use a Java-like synchronization on any object that implements the activemq::concurrent::Synchronizable interface.</p>
