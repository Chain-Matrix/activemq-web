<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><h2>Dependencies</h2><h3>libuuid</h3><p>On *nix sytems, the build requires the libuuid library that is part of the e2fsprogs package and is available from <a shape="rect" href="http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/">http://e2fsprogs.sourceforge.net/</a> which is not always installed by default.</p><p>On Fedora/Red Hat/openSUSE, you should install the e2fsprogs and e2fsprogs-devel packages. On Debian/Ubuntu, you should install uuid and uuid-dev packages.</p><h3>CppUnit</h3><p>The package contains a complete set of CppUnit tests. In order for you to build an run the tests, you will need to download and install the CppUnit library. See <a shape="rect" href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cppunit-wiki">http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cppunit-wiki</a></p><p>On Fedora/Red Hat/openSUSE, you should install the cppunit and cppunit-devel packages. On Debian/Ubuntu, you should install the build-essential, libcppunit and libcppunit-dev packages.</p><p>Make sure that the paths to the installed CppUnit library and includes are visible in your current shell before you try building the tests.</p><p>Windows users will need to build the CppUnit library using the CppUnit MSVC project files. A discussion of the build process can be found on the CppUnit wiki under <a shape="rect" href="http://cppunit.sourceforge.net/cppunit-wiki/BuildingCppUnit1">CppUnit build instructions</a> this covers both MSVC along with many other platforms and tool suites.</p><h3>APR</h3><p>With versions of ActiveMQ-CPP 2.2 and later, we have a dependency on the <a shape="rect" href="http://apr.apache.org">Apache Portable Runtime</a> project. You'll need to install APR on your system before you'll be able to build ActiveMQ-CPP.</p><structured-macro ac:macro-id="814f1ae0-dcb7-4d54-90fa-842fa65b55b2" ac:name="note" ac:schema-version="1"><parameter ac:name="title">Note to Windows Vista/MSVC++ 2008 Users</parameter><rich-text-body><p>The Vista SDK has introduced some build problems for APR.

These allow you to validate this distribution of ActiveMQ CPP against your broker. Running these without a broker will result in failed tests. The tests currently hard-code the broker url to be tcp://localhost:61613 for stomp and tcp://localhost:61616 for openwire.</p><p>The integration tests are built via "make check".

</plain-text-body></structured-macro><h2>Building on Windows with MSVC</h2><p>We support using the GNU compiler on Windows, using the Cygwin package. However we also support using the MSVC compiler on Windows.</p><p>There are a couple or things that you will need to setup to ensure that the MSVC compile succeeds.</p><h3>Including Dependencies</h3><p>The Project files reference the libraries described in the <link ac:anchor="Dependencies"><plain-text-link-body>#Dependencies</plain-text-link-body></link> section. To build successfully, you must either place these libraries in a directory listed in the project settings, or add a new location for your library directories.</p><h3>MSVC &gt;= 2008</h3><p>If you're using MSVC &gt;= 2008, it comes with the Windows SDK (so you don't need to download it separately).</p><p>For ActiveMQ-CPP &gt;= 2.2, you will have to follow some special instructions for building APR, duscussed <link ac:anchor="APR"><plain-text-link-body>here</plain-text-link-body></link>.</p><h3>Non-Vista/MSVC &lt; 2008</h3><p>If you are using Visual C++ &lt; 2008, you need to download and install the Platform SDK if you don't have it installed already (the Platform SDK is called the "Windows SDK" since the release of Windows Vista). Once installed, do the following:</p><ul><li>Ensure that the path to your MSVC install is set in the PATH env variable. You can test this by typing cl.exe at the command line, if you get an error complaining that it is not found, then you'll need to fix your PATH. Alternatively, you can set up the necessary environment variables by running C:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\Common7\Tools\vsvars32.bat.</li><li><p>Set the INCLUDE env variable to include the path to your MSVC includes, and the platform SDK includes. For example:</p><structured-macro ac:macro-id="91677a7e-17d3-4b1d-9304-a1be2b117dc0" ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1"><plain-text-body>INCLUDE = D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\include;D:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Include\*
</plain-text-body></structured-macro></li><li><p>Set the LIB env variable to include the path to your MSVC libs, and the Platform SDK libs. For example:</p><structured-macro ac:macro-id="d6b15ce1-20b3-4d30-becc-a721b3698e86" ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1"><plain-text-body>LIB = D:\Program Files\Microsoft Visual Studio 8\VC\lib;D:\Program Files\Microsoft Platform SDK\Lib
