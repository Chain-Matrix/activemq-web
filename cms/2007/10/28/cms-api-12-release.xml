<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><p>In preparation for the soon-to-be-released ActiveMQ-CPP 2.1.1, we're releasing version 1.2 of the CMS (C++ Messaging Service) API.  The main change in this release is that the readXXX() methods in BytesMessage were made const so that they may be used from within the MessageListener's onMessage method.  You can download CMS 1.2 <link><page ri:content-title="CMS API 1.2 Release"></page><link-body>here</link-body></link></p></div>
