By using the STLPort library you get access to the features we need, but you must compile your application with STLPort as well to insure compatibility with our library.</p><p>So in you own makefiles you must pass -library=stlport4 to CC when you build and link.</p><p>You can find out more from Sun on this at <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/solaris/cmp-stlport-libcstd-142559.html" rel="nofollow">STL Library Comparison</a></p></div>
