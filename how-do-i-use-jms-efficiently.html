<p>JMS is designed for high performance. In particular its design is such that you are meant to create a number of objects up front on the startup of your application and then resuse them throughout your application. e.g. its a good idea to create upfront and then reuse the following</p>

<ul><li>Connection</li><li>Session</li><li>MessageProducer</li><li>MessageConsumer</li></ul>


<p>The reason is that each create &amp; destroy of the above objects typically requires an individual request &amp; response with the JMS broker to ensure it worked. e.g. creating a connection, session, producer, then sending a message, then closing everything down again - could result in 7 request-responses with the server!</p>

<p>Note a little trick - you can reuse the same MessageProducer for sending messages to different destinations; just create it with a null destination and specify it on the send method.</p>

This means that when the pooled MessageProducer is in use no advisories for producers will ever be sent.</p></div></div>

<p>To use JMS efficiently we recommend you use <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/">Camel</a> to hide the JMS API and <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://activemq.apache.org/camel/bean-integration.html">bind the messaging to your beans</a>. </p>

<p>Alternatively try using Spring's <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html#jms-mdp" rel="nofollow">MessageListenerContainer</a> for consuming messages and <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/jms.html#jms-jmstemplate" rel="nofollow">JmsTemplate</a> for sending - but be <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://activemq.apache.org/jmstemplate-gotchas.html">aware of the gotchas</a></p>

<p><a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://java.sun.com/j2ee/connector/" rel="nofollow">Java Connector Architecture</a> supports the pooling of JMS connections, sessions and MessageListeners, parallel message processing, thread pooling and transaction &amp; exception handling, through the use of a JCA <a shape="rect" href="resource-adapter.html">Resource Adapter</a>.</p>

If you need XA support then you must use JCA</p></div></div>

<p>Typically JCA is used in a J2EE container via MDBs; though there is a POJO Spring based <a shape="rect" href="jca-container.html">JCA Container</a> you can use, which is simple and lightweight and easy to embed inside Tomcat or any J2SE application.</p></div>
