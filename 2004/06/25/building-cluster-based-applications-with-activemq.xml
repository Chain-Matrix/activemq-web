<p>There's a new lightweight library available called <a shape="rect" href="http://activecluster.codehaus.org/">ActiveCluster</a> which provides a simple cluster abstraction on top of some of the core APIs in JMS. This API allows you to monitor nodes in a cluster, watch them come &amp; go or update their state - or send and receive messages, direct to a member of the cluster or as the group as a whole. For more details on the API see this <a shape="rect" href="http://activecluster.codehaus.org/Overview">overview</a>.</p>

<p>ActiveCluster can sit neatly on top of ActiveMQ to provide a lightweight, scalable and partitionable cluster communication fabric. See the <a shape="rect" href="http://activecluster.codehaus.org/Examples?refresh=1">examples</a> as a quick way to get started.</p></div>
