<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><h2>How can I get a list of the topics and queues in a broker?</h2>

<p>As of 5.1.0 you can use the new <a shape="rect" href="http://activemq.apache.org/maven/activemq-core/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/advisory/DestinationSource.html">DestinationSource</a> on an ActiveMQConnection to access the available queues or topics or listen to queues/topics being created or deleted.</p>

<p>You can use <link><page ri:content-title="JMX"></page></link> to browse the available topics and queues in a broker together with the connectors and connections along with their statistics etc.</p>

<p>Or you can access statistics <link><page ri:content-title="How can I see what destinations are used"></page><link-body>programmatically</link-body></link>.</p>

<p>Finally you could just use the <link><page ri:content-title="Web Console"></page></link></p></div>
