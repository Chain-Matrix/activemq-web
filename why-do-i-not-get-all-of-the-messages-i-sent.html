<p>As <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://forums.logicblaze.com/posts/list/0/14.page#37" rel="nofollow">Matt reported</a> its possible that there is a race condition in your application; are you sure you had created your consumer and called start() on the JMS Connection before the producer started publishing messages?</p>
