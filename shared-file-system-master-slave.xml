This effectively renders the ActiveMQ data directory inaccessible because the ActiveMQ slave broker can't acquire the lock and therefore cannot start up. The only solution to this predicament with NFSv3 is to reboot all ActiveMQ instances to reset everything.</p><p>Use of NFSv4 is another solution because its design includes timeouts for locks. When using NFSv4 and the client holding the lock experiences an abnormal termination, by design, the lock is released after 30 seconds, allowing another client to grab the lock. For more information about this, see <a shape="rect" href="http://blogs.netapp.com/eislers_nfs_blog/2008/07/part-i-since-nf.html">this blog entry</a>.</p></rich-text-body></structured-macro></rich-text-body></structured-macro><p>Basically you can run as many brokers as you wish from the same shared file system directory. The first broker to grab the exclusive lock on the file is the master broker. If that broker dies and releases the lock then another broker takes over. The slave brokers sit in a loop trying to grab the lock from the master broker.</p><p>The following example shows how to configure a broker for Shared File System Master Slave where <strong>/sharedFileSystem</strong> is some directory on a shared file system. It is just a case of configuring a file based store to use a shared directory.</p><structured-macro ac:macro-id="a9501ea9-3a9e-4a57-af82-e214b13403ef" ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1"><plain-text-body>    &lt;persistenceAdapter&gt;

With a shared file-system it is therefore important to tell ActiveMQ expressly where to store scheduler information. To do this, set the&#160;<code>dataDirectory</code> attribute on the&#160;<code>broker</code>, for example:</p><structured-macro ac:macro-id="4f436336-254b-4003-8118-ee80b6f4c689" ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1"><parameter ac:name="language">xml</parameter><plain-text-body>&lt;broker xmlns="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"
