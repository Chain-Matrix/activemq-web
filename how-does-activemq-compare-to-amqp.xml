<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><p><link><page ri:content-title="AMQP"></page></link> stands for the <em>Advanced Message Queue Protocol</em> and is a specification for how messaging clients and brokers can interoperate. AMQP is a specification of a wire-level protocol for client to message broker communication.  It is not a messaging system like ActiveMQ, but just a messaging protocol.</p>

<p>ActiveMQ now implements AMQP 1.0!</p>

<p>ActiveMQ also supports other open wire protocols:</p>

<ul><li><link><page ri:content-title="OpenWire"></page></link>, a fast binary format</li><li><link><page ri:content-title="Stomp"></page></link>, a simple and easily implemented text based-protocol</li><li><link><page ri:content-title="MQTT"></page></link>, a compact binary format for limited devices on an unreliable network</li></ul>


<p>Through these protocols, ActiveMQ can support clients in C, C++, C#, Ruby, Python, Perl, PHP, Pike etc. AMQP is most similar to OpenWire, because both OpenWire and AMQP are designed for high performance messaging, through a binary (rather than text-based) format. As a text-based format, STOMP is much easier to implement, but gives somewhat slower performance.</p></div>
