<p>Administered objects refers to objects that are configured in <a shape="rect" href="jndi-support.html">JNDI</a> and then accessed by a JMS client. So they are simply client-side objects typically either a ConnectionFactory or a Destination (such as a Queue or Topic).</p>

<p>Note that administered objects are only used for JNDI. JNDI can then be used as a level of indirection between the JNDI API and the concrete API of the JMS provider. So looking up objects in JNDI avoids you having a runtime dependency on ActiveMQ. Given that we are only talking about one ConnectionFactory object and a few Destination objects, this is not a huge big deal though <img class="emoticon emoticon-smile" src="https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/s/en_GB/5997/6f42626d00e36f53fe51440403446ca61552e2a2.1/_/images/icons/emoticons/smile.png" data-emoticon-name="smile" alt="(smile)"></p>

<p>Often folks get very confused with JNDI. e.g. in RMI / EJB scenarios JNDI provides client side proxies; this is not the case with JMS, as the JMS client is the client side proxy to the broker.</p>

<p>An alternative approach to creating administered objects in JNDI is to just use the <a shape="rect" href="spring-support.html">Spring Support</a> and let dependency injection be an alternative to JNDI.</p>
