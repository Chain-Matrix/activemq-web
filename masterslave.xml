<p>If you are using a shared network file system such as a SAN we recommend a <link><page ri:content-title="Shared File System Master Slave"></page></link>. If you are happy to dispense with the high performance journal and are using pure JDBC as your persistence engine then you should use <link><page ri:content-title="JDBC Master Slave"></page></link> instead.  For those willing to try out new tech, the <link><page ri:content-title="Replicated LevelDB Store"></page></link> gives speeds similar to a SAN solution without the hassle of having to setup a highly available shared file system.</p></div>
