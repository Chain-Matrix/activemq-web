<p>Spread Toolkit is a C++ library for messaging and only has <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://www.spread.org/JMS4Spread/docs/" rel="nofollow">partial support for JMS</a>. It doesn't support durable messaging, transactions, XA or full JMS 1.1. It is also dependent on a native code Spread daemon running on the machine.</p>

<p>Apache ActiveMQ on the other hand is the JMS provider used in <a shape="rect" class="external-link" href="http://geronimo.apache.org">Apache Geronimo</a> and is J2EE 1.4 certified in Geronimo and is 100% pure Java. ActiveMQ supports transient and durable messaging, transactions, XA, J2EE 1.4, JMS 1.1, JCA 1.5 as well as heaps of different features like <a shape="rect" href="message-groups.html">Message Groups</a> and <a shape="rect" href="clustering.html">Clustering</a></p>
