<p>You don't need to explicitly <a shape="rect" href="how-do-i-configure-the-queues-i-want.html">configure distributed queues or topics</a> as any queue or topic is automatically distributed across other brokers when the brokers are configured in either a store and forward network or a master/slave cluster. </p>

<p>So you just need to connect brokers together to form either</p>

<ul><li>a <a shape="rect" href="networks-of-brokers.html">Store and Forward Network of Brokers</a>, which means the messages travel from broker to broker until they reach a consumer; with each message being owned by a single broker at any point in time</li><li>a <a shape="rect" href="masterslave.html">Master/Slave Cluster</a>, which means all messages are replicated across each broker in the master/slave cluster</li></ul>
