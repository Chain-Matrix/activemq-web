Reason:  java.io.exception : could not find class for resource: META-INF/services/org/apache/activemq/transport/tcp
</plain-text-body></structured-macro>
<p>&#160;</p>

<h3>Cause</h3>

<p>You are probably using the ActiveMQ source code without using the resources</p>

<h3>Quick fix</h3>

<p>Try one of these</p>
<ul><li>use one of the distribution jars for ActiveMQ</li><li>use Maven to run your program</li><li>try adding activemq/src/conf to your classpath</li></ul>


<h3>Background</h3>

<p>Then it means that the files in META-INF/services could not be found on the classpath. These files are used to support loose coupling on ActiveMQ with the transport protocols (e.g. to avoid a classpath dependency on JXTA) and to allow dynamic protocol enhancement without a change to the core.</p>

<p>So we're using the META-INF/services files as a way of coupling a protocol used in URL connections to a Java class name.</p></div>
