<p>As is described in <a shape="rect" href="how-do-i-create-new-destinations.xml">How do I create new destinations</a> there is no need to create all the destinations up front, you can let the broker create them on the fly.</p>

<p>However if you don't want this behaviour, or wish to restrict this behaviour to certain topic or queue <a shape="rect" href="wildcards.xml">Wildcards</a> (areas of the queue or topic name space) then you can use the <a shape="rect" href="security.xml">Security</a> plugins to disallow the <strong>admin</strong> role on whatever areas of the queue and topic namespace you wish</p></div>
