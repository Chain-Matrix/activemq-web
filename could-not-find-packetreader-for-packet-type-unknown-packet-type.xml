<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><h3>Error</h3>

<structured-macro ac:macro-id="d1a91181-524f-47f6-9389-3bb5a7ef5e6c" ac:name="code" ac:schema-version="1"><plain-text-body>
Could not find PacketReader for packet type: UNKNOWN PACKET TYPE: -102
</plain-text-body></structured-macro>

<h3>Reason</h3>

<p>You are probably using different versions of ActiveMQ jars on the client and the broker. Try using the same jars on each node and the problem should go away.</p>

<p>Once 4.0 is GA we will be freezing the wire format version then increasing it for every future GA release - so the error message you get going forward should be more explicit</p></div>
