<div class="wiki-content maincontent"><p>Apache ActiveMQ 5.3.0 has an official <a shape="rect" href="http://www.spec.org/jms2007/">SPECjms2007&#174;</a> result, thanks to some great work by <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dvs.tu-darmstadt.de/staff/ksachs/">Kai Sachs</a> from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dvs.tu-darmstadt.de/">Databases and Distributed Systems Group</a> at the Technical University Darmstadt in Germany. Complete details can be found in the official results submission that is linked from the <a shape="rect" href="http://www.dvs.tu-darmstadt.de/news/specjms2007Results.html">announcement</a>.<br clear="none">
Needless to say, 5.3.0 does nicely in both horizontal (number of destinations) and vertical (load per destination) scalability.<br clear="none">
It is fitting to see Apache ActiveMQ being used in the world's first SPECjms2007 submission.</p></div>
